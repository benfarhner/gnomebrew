Gnomebrew
=========

Gnomebrew is a text-based sandbox adventure game, with a focus on complex crafting and brewing recipes to create new objects.


Installation
------------

Gnomebrew is currently being written in C++ and compiled under Mac OS X 10.7. It has not been tested under any other platforms at this time, so there are no guarantees it will work for you!

To compile, set the gnomebrew folder as your current working directory and run `make`. If no errors occurred, run the game with `./gnomebrew`.


Gameplay
--------

You are a gnome. When you start a new game, you can pick your name and gender, or let them be chosen randomly for you (this is not implemented yet!).

Typical gameplay involves moving around the map with the arrow keys, interacting with and creating objects to build your world.

### Key Commands
* `F1` brings up the pause menu. The options are pretty straightforward.
* `h` harvests, or grabs, the top item on the tile your gnome is currently on. Not all items can be harvested!


Time
----

Time is very important in Gnomebrew! Plants grow and die, food spoils, and beverages ferment. Pay close attention to the time and date for successful.
