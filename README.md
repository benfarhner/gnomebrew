# Gnomebrew

Gnomebrew is a text-based sandbox adventure game, with a focus on complex crafting and brewing recipes to create new objects.

## Gameplay

You are a gnome. When you start a new game, you can pick your name and gender, or let them be chosen randomly for you. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

Typical gameplay involves moving around the map with the arrow keys, interacting with and creating objects to build your world.

Press F1 to bring up the main menu. The options are pretty straightforward.

### Time

Time is very important in Gnomebrew! Plants grow and die, food spoils, and beverages ferment. Pay close attention to the time and date for successful.
