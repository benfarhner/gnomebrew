The Gnomes of Gnomebrew naturally speak Gnomish. Of Gnomish, there are 2 main dialects, both derived from Old Gnomish: Northern Gnomish and Southern Gnomish (as we call them in English).

# Old Gnomish
Old Gnomish is a very ancient language that is rarely seen in Gnomebrew, except perhaps in the occasional landmark or place name.

## Orthography

## Syntax
The structure of Old Gnomish sentences is, generally, VSO (verb-subject-object). Adjectives come after nouns and adverbs come after verbs.

# Northern Gnomish
The Gnomes of the North speak a distinct dialect derived from Old Gnomish and developed over centuries of living in the cold North Gardens.

# Southern Gnomish
The language of the Gnomes of the South is equally distinct and yet still derived from Old Gnomish. In the warmer South Gardens, these Gnomes developed their own words and colloquialisms to fit their environment.
